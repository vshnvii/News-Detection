# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based system that detects whether a given news article is real or fake. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text and classify it accordingly.

## Features
- Preprocessing of news articles (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
- Model training using machine learning algorithms.
- Performance evaluation with accuracy and F1-score.
- User-friendly interface for testing news articles (if applicable).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK/spacy  
- **Machine Learning Model:** (Specify your model, e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- **Framework (if UI is included):** Flask/Streamlit  

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
